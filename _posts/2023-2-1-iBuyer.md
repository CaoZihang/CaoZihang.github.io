# iBuyer行业

iBuyers

**Matt Levine**

The last few years saw a big rise and fall in the “iBuyer” business model, where companies like Opendoor Technologies Inc. and Zillow Group Inc. used their scale, data and pricing algorithms to get into the market-making business for houses. The iBuyers would offer to buy houses instantly, for cash, with not much in the way of due diligence, which was all very appealing to sellers; they would then have a big inventory of houses that they could flip to buyers. Instead of buyers and sellers meeting each other in messy imperfect markets, the sellers could all sell to the iBuyers and the buyers could all buy from the iBuyers and the iBuyers could intermediate every trade and earn a spread for providing liquidity.

This is in many ways a clever idea, though it also has some important difficulties that the iBuyers have not entirely solved, and we have [talked](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/30401764.408088/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEtMTAtMTgvdGhlLWNvbXB1dGVyLWNhbi10LWJ1eS15b3VyLWhvdXNlLW5vdz9jbXBpZD1CQkQwMTMwMjNfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yMzAxMzAmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/62d6320cd4f9ed91850b6e9cB78d68962) about it a [lot](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/30401764.408088/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEtMTEtMDMvemlsbG93LWlzLWRvbmUtdHJhZGluZy1ob3VzZXM_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDEzMDIzX01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjMwMTMwJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/62d6320cd4f9ed91850b6e9cB692814ec) around [here](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/30401764.408088/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEtMTEtMTgvemlsbG93LXRyaWVkLXRvLW1ha2UtbGVzcy1tb25leT9jbXBpZD1CQkQwMTMwMjNfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yMzAxMzAmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/62d6320cd4f9ed91850b6e9cB680f3ee7). One obvious thing to say about this business model is that it is lucrative if house prices are generally increasing (you buy a house, the price goes up, you sell it) and bad if house prices are generally decreasing (you buy a house, the price goes down, you sell it). And in fact iBuying was good for a while and then bad; Opendoor and Zillow have taken a bath on it, and Zillow shut down its iBuying group in late 2021.

But another thing to say about this business model is that, if house prices are generally increasing, this model can *look predatory*. “Zillow is pushing up the price of houses and making them unaffordable, all in the pursuit of evil corporate profits,” people could say, [and did](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/30401764.408088/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZlYXR1cmVzLzIwMjItMDEtMDcvYnV5aW5nLXN0YXJ0ZXItaG9tZXMtZ2V0cy1oYXJkZXItYXMtd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtdXNlcy16aWxsb3ctdG8tYnV5LXRob3VzYW5kcz9jbXBpZD1CQkQwMTMwMjNfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yMzAxMzAmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/62d6320cd4f9ed91850b6e9cB612da1ce), when Zillow was buying a lot of houses and house prices were going up. Back in 2021, [we talked about](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/30401764.408088/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEtMDktMjgvd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tc3dhcHBlZC1zb21lLWRpZ2l0cz9jbXBpZD1CQkQwMTMwMjNfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yMzAxMzAmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/62d6320cd4f9ed91850b6e9cB25283b8f) “a TikTok video that said an unnamed company was pulling off a convoluted scheme to manipulate housing prices,” by buying a bunch of $300,000 houses for $300,000, then buying one more for $340,000, then selling all 31 for $340,000. This is not really all that plausible as a form of market manipulation, but it was empirically true that for a while rising house prices correlated to the rise of iBuyers, so you can see where the idea came from.

But then [home prices started falling](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/30401764.408088/aHR0cHM6Ly9mcmVkLnN0bG91aXNmZWQub3JnL3Nlcmllcy9DU1VTSFBJU0E/62d6320cd4f9ed91850b6e9cB2e90fa5f) and iBuyers started losing their shirts. And so you might expect to see a lot of articles saying, like, “Opendoor is pushing down the price of houses and making them more affordable, all in the pursuit of hilarious corporate losses.” I mean, I don’t know, when I say it like that, I guess you wouldn’t expect to see a *lot* of those articles? But here’s a great one! It’s from Bloomberg’s [Prashant Gopal and Patrick Clark](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/30401764.408088/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZlYXR1cmVzLzIwMjMtMDEtMzAvd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtaXMtbG9zaW5nLW91dC10by1maXJzdC10aW1lLWhvbWVidXllcnMtdGhpcy1ob3VzaW5nLXNsdW1wP2NtcGlkPUJCRDAxMzAyM19NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIzMDEzMCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/62d6320cd4f9ed91850b6e9cB8f9057db):

> [Individual home-flipper Raad] Yousif punches in a code and swings open the door to his most lucrative 2022 flip, a two-bedroom town home in this development. He unloaded it last spring, just as the market was starting to sink. Big institutions from Silicon Valley and Wall Street were still on a buying binge, at times making unbelievable offers sight unseen. In this case a company called Opendoor Technologies Inc. in April paid $265,000—$30,000 above the five other bidders, he says.
>
> Opendoor is now asking $218,000, a $47,000 loss, not including its fees and renovation expenses. But even that asking price is too high, Yousif says. After four price cuts, he smells blood. He’s eager to buy back the home he once owned. “It’s always about the right number,” he says. 

Yes if you find a market maker who is bad at market making, you should sell to them high and buy back low, like Yousif did. A market maker like that won’t last long, and [many iBuyers didn’t](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/30401764.408088/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVyZWFsZGVhbC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8wNy9pYnV5aW5nLW9uLXRoZS1icmluay13aGVyZS1kb2VzLXRoZS1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLWhvbWVidXlpbmctbW9kZWwtZ28tZnJvbS1oZXJlLw/62d6320cd4f9ed91850b6e9cB146701c7), though Opendoor is still in the business. But you have to take advantage while you can. And there’s this:

> Laurie Tayrien, a former schoolteacher, and her husband, Rick, love the new market. They just snapped up the deal of a lifetime for a Phoenix three-bedroom built in the 1980s. Surrounded by golf courses, below a mountain vista, it was quite an upgrade from their previous home, in a crime-ridden neighborhood.
>
> In November the Tayriens paid $485,000 for what they call “their forever home.” In June the seller, Opendoor, had paid $646,800. That’s a 25% loss in just five months. …
>
> The couple are busy on a $50,000 renovation of their kitchen, where plywood counters wait to be topped in quartz. The Tayriens have the cash in part because of a bungled bet by a big institution. “They rode a wave, and it’s crashing on them,” Laurie says. “It’s a corporation. I don’t feel bad for them.”

Of course not! What a feel-good financial story. “Giant corporations swooped into the market for homes and gave everyone cheap houses, because they were dumb.” In general, people tend to be suspicious of financial intermediation, because the intermediaries are making money and it feels like that must be at your expense. But here the intermediaries were losing money, and that had to be good for someone.

Zillow is an online real estate company that provides an estimate of a property's value through its Zestimate algorithm. The algorithm considers factors such as location, home features, and recent sales data to provide an estimate of a property's value.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant changes in the real estate market, including shifts in demand for different types of properties and changes in home values. This has created challenges for Zillow as its Zestimate algorithm has struggled to keep pace with these changes.

One example of this is the sudden shift in demand for larger homes with more outdoor space, as people adjust to working and living in the same place. The Zestimate algorithm may not have been able to fully reflect this change in demand, leading to incorrect estimates of home values.

Additionally, the pandemic has caused a slowdown in the real estate market, making it more difficult for Zillow to access the most recent sales data to update its algorithm. This has further impacted the accuracy of the Zestimate.

In order to better address these challenges, Zillow could consider incorporating additional data sources into its algorithm, such as real-time market data, or seeking out partnerships with real estate experts to provide additional insight into changes in the market.

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the limitations of Zillow's reliance on the Zestimate algorithm in rapidly changing market conditions. The company must take steps to adapt and improve its algorithm to better reflect changes in the real estate market.
